## Presentation Summary

My presentation focuses on exploring the intersection of robot and gender. The question of whether it is moral to have assign genders to robots have long interests me. To me, although I assume the robots are genderless when I first see them, I realize I still use the pronouns of he/him to refer to them more than anything. So I started the research on how does people think of robot gender. Through reading papers and companies published surveys, there are a few fundamental truths that revealed itself. It is that human’s interaction with the computers is social. Social norms applied including gender cues. “Computers are gendered social actors.” (Nass 77) Also, users will unconsciously have certain expectation and tendency to like some personalities over the other and certain gender for one specific job that the robots are carrying out. (Tay, Jung, Park 78) So for the companies to sell their products, it is essential that the robots are demonstrating the social cues and behavior that users are expecting more. After establishing those facts, I went on to the problems behind the gendering of robots, including treatments to the gendered robots, how do we protect their right, and how they reinforce gender biases. And eventually proposing some solutions that is talked about in some evaluation paper. For example, it is proposed to design gender-fluid robot and prioritize gender equality. Finally, we jump into discussion, where I proposed the following questions:

- How do you feel about Q the first genderless voice virtual assistant?
- Do you think there is a need to gender robots?
- If not what do you think gender-neutral robots are the way to go?
- In the future, if we do create gendered robots how do we protect their rights?
- Do you think there is a way to have robots step out of human social relations?
- Can we regulate creators on what gender of robots they are allowed to build?
