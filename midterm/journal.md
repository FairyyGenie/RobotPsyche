# Journal for midterm Project

### 2/27: Added the night and day feature
 Trying to add steering force but it is not working yet.
 
 Started to think maybe I need to include all environment features into a bigger class call environment instead of just having functions.
 
 Have implemented the night button, but it is not working properly switching between night and day yet.
 
### 3/2: Figure out What kind of characteristics I want my ecosystem to have

  Read a few article on how the fireflies work.
  
  Decided on adding:
  1. Spooked by light and can only roam around freely during night time
  2. Have worms as their food
  3. Have female and male meet in order to reproduce

### 3/4: Added Worms and FMover(female fireflies) class
 
 Added the attraction ability onto worms and female fireflies, so the worms and female are attracting the male fireflies.
 
 Updated the nolight and nolightupdate functions within the fireflies classes, so that the fireflies have the traits to roam around in the comfort of the night.
 
### 3/7: Implemented the texts onscreen and test out all the forces between the creatures that are impacting each other

Also added some rules for reproduction for example the conditions have to be met for the reproduction process to start. 
Tried refining the steering function so it looks more natural.

### 3/8: Finish the project and Github page
