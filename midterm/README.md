## Midterm Ecology project
### Continuing the FireFlies Ecology system
Added concepts to become an ecosystem:
1. fireflies reproduce larvae 
(if condition met I set it to be having to eat at least 10 worms and the female and the male have to encounter at least 3 times)


2. when there are light then the fireflies fly outwards disappeared 


3. when there are no light then the fireflies roam around 
(the **night button** can help switch the night and day mode)


4. female and male meet 
(yellow fireflies are the male, and the pink ones are the female)


5. fireflies eat the worms
(the tiny rectangle are the worms)


6. human comes in and the ecosystem is disrupted (The triangle in the day time represent human)
