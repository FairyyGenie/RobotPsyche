## Midterm Ecology project
### Continuing the FireFlies Ecology system
Added concepts to become an ecosystem:
1. fireflies reproduce larvae 
(if condition met I set it to be having to eat at least 10 worms and the female and the male have to encounter at least 3 times)


2. when there are light then the fireflies fly outwards disappeared 


3. when there are no light then the fireflies roam around 
(the **night button** can help switch the night and day mode)


4. female and male meet 
(yellow fireflies are the male, and the pink ones are the female)


5. fireflies eat the worms
(the tiny rectangle are the worms)


6. human comes in and the ecosystem is disrupted (The triangle in the day time represent human)

### Process and Problems of implementation:



### Interesting thing:
When implementing the ecosystem, I expected that reproduction and consumption of worms will be harder under the daytime mode since humans can come in to disrupt the ecosystem.
But after implementation, I realized it is not neccesarily the case. Maybe because in my program, when human shows up it pushes the fireflies to the side. And when all the fireflies are on the side, they meet each other more easily and get to eat the worms on the corner easily. The reproduction rule I set for the system is that when more than 10 worms have been eaten and the male and female fireflies have encountered each other for more than 3 times in order for the larvae to be produced.
