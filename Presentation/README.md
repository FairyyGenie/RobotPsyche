### Discussion Questions:
How do you feel about Q the first genderless voice virtual assistant?

Do you think there is a need to gender robots?

If not what do you think gender-neutral robots are the way to go?

In the future, if we do create gendered robots how do we protect their rights? 

Do you think there is a way to have robots step out of human social relations?

Can we regulate creators on what gender of robots they are allowed to build?
