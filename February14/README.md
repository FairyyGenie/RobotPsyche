## The fireflies escaping project
### Concept:

I want to create a ecosystem projecr where the movers are like the fireflies and the mouse is like the light source. In my understanding of fireflies, they flew away from anything that shines too bright. 

So in this project I want to have the movers move away from the mouse.

### Problems:

When the fireflies is moving away if I don't adjust the checkEdge function, then the flies will be stuck at the edge of the frame. 

I had to also create the checkloc function to try to create the sense that the fireflies moves around instead of to just one direction, but it also makes it seem like there are new flies flying out.


### Clever Ideas:

I realized that with setting some color variable to a certain number and the other to randomly select number I can create the circles to be having the sense like they are flickering like the actual fireflies.
